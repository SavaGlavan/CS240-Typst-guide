  Typst is a new markup-based typesetting system for the sciences. It is designed to be an alternative both to advanced tools like LaTeX and simpler tools like Word and Google Docs. Our goal with Typst is to build a typesetting tool that is highly capable and a pleasure to use.

To familiarize yourselves with Typst I would suggest you read #link("https://typst.app/docs/tutorial/")[the official Typst tutorial] and consult #link("https://github.com/johanvx/typst-undergradmath")[the Typst Undergrad guide document].
You won't need to read the whole tutorial, however this document assumes you know the basics of using Typst.
You should be comfortable with the following before continuing:
+ How you will use Typst. Typst has an excellent online editor as well as a CLI. Which will you use?
+ Basic syntax.
+ Using math mode.
+ Simple formatting.
+ Using external packages.

Once you are familiar with Typst and comfortable using it, you will be able to make the most of this guide as it will show you how you can use Typst to succeed in CS240.
